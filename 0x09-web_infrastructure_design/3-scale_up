### Web Infrastructure Design: Scaling Up

#### Components Added and Reasons

1. **Web Server**
   - **Why Added**: Handles static content, offloads dynamic requests to the application server, improving performance and security.

2. **Application Server**
   - **Why Added**: Processes dynamic requests and business logic, isolating these functions from the web server to enhance efficiency and security.

3. **Database Server**
   - **Why Added**: Manages data storage and retrieval, providing centralized and optimized data management.

4. **Load Balancer (HAproxy)**
   - **Why Added**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, preventing any single server from being overwhelmed and ensuring high availability.

5. **HAproxy Cluster**
   - **Why Added**: Ensures high availability of the load balancer, preventing a single point of failure in the load balancing layer.
